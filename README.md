This GitHub repository provides the EEG dataset proposed in the research work titled:
# "MI-SLM: An EEG Dataset for Exploring Motor Imagery Single-Limb Movement in Human–Machine Interaction Systems"





The dataset is designed to support Motor Imagery (MI)-based Brain–Computer Interface (BCI) research, particularly in the domain of single-limb movement decoding and human–machine interaction systems. It provides a foundation for studies in neuroprosthetic control, robotic exoskeleton operation, post-stroke rehabilitation, and neural motor-function decoding.

The implementation and experimental analysis are provided in **Python Notebook**.
