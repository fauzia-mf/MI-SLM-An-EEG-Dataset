This GitHub repository provides the EEG dataset proposed in the research work titled:
# "MI-SLM: An EEG Dataset for Exploring Motor Imagery Single-Limb Movement in Human–Machine Interaction Systems"





The dataset is designed to support Motor Imagery (MI)-based Brain–Computer Interface (BCI) research, particularly in the domain of single-limb movement decoding and human–machine interaction systems. It provides a foundation for studies in neuroprosthetic control, robotic exoskeleton operation, post-stroke rehabilitation, and neural motor-function decoding.


## 🧠 Motor Imagery Dataset

We provide a Motor Imagery (MI) dataset consisting of recordings from **18 subjects**.

Detailed information about the experimental protocol, data acquisition process, and dataset structure can be found in our paper:
